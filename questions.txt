 Add an unordered list to this web page. An unordered list should look like the following when it is shown by a browser:
 An unordered list can be specified with the tags <ul> and </ul>.
 An unordered list typically contains a number of list items that can be specified with tags <li> and </li>.
 After you have created your unordered list, check out what happens when you convert it to an ordered list by replacing the tags <ul> and </ul> with <ol> and </ol>, respectively.

7. Create another .html file that contains a heading and a couple of paragraphs. You could name this new file another_page.html, and you should place it into the same folder where your first .html is. After you have created the new .html page, add a link to the first page so that the browser will load another_page.html when you click the text Go to the other page. in the first page. You need to use the <a> and </a> tags in this exercise. Inside the tag <a> you need to use a href attribute that specifies which page will be loaded when the link is clicked.

8. HTML tags like <a> can have certain attributes. The href attribute is mandatory in the <a> tag. Additionally it is possible to use the title attribute which specifies a text that emerges when the mouse cursor is moved above a link. This kind of text is called a tool tip. Modify the link that you created in the previous exercise so that a tool tip says "This leads you to another page." when the mouse cursor is over the link.
